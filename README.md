IOT BASED WEATHER STATION MONITORING USING NODEMCU

Weather is the most important element that affects farm production. It can influence crop growth, total yield, pest occurrence, water and fertilizer need and all farm activities carried out during the growing season. In other words, farming under open sky is greatly reliant upon weather. Climate change can lead to unpredictable weather which is beyond human control. A farmer cannot predict weather conditions; however he can adapt to the given situation and take additional farm management practices to minimize the crop losses. Therefore, accurate information regarding weather is important so that farming activities can be planned without any adverse effects. The only way to manage and ensure profitable crop production is by accurate weather forecasts. Available on any device (radio, TV, mobile or computer), it gives great value to farmers whose success largely depends on weather. Our project aims at monitoring weather conditions at a particular place and making the data accessible in Blynk application and Thingspeak cloud by interfacing sensors with Nodemcu.
